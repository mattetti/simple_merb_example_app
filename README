This is just a simple example of a merb app. This code is auto-generated by a script following different steps. Each step is available in its own branch. If you use a software like gitx http://gitx.frim.nl/ gitnub or gitk you can easily see the diff between each branch.

Because each step is a branch, you can easily decide to hack on a specific branch and apply the "newest branches" if needed.

The code is not guaranteed to work, and I'm not even sure about this project will stick around or that I will keep on trying to maintain branches.
